# About me
I am computer science student at Rochester Institute of Technology.  RIT offers a challenging computer science cirriculumn unlike those offered
at other universities.
<br>
At RIT, I am a System Administrator for [Computer Science House](https://csh.rit.edu), a special interest residence floor focused on computing
and group learning.
<br>
I enjoy programming in Python, Java, and C. I am also a Debian user despite white my coworkers tell me.
