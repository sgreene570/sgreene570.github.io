# About me
I am a computer science student at the Rochester Institute of Technology.  Believe it or not, RIT offers a challenging computer science curriculum unlike those offered
at other universities.
<br>
At RIT, I am a System Administrator for [Computer Science House](https://csh.rit.edu), a special interest residence floor focused on computing
and learning through technical projects.
<br>
I enjoy programming in Python, Java, C, and Go. I am also quite the Debian user.
