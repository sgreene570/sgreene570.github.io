Recently I aquired the domain [zee.pics](https://zee.pics) for the low price of $2.99 / year. My cat Zee was delighted to begin
his fast track to being internet famous. Once I settled on Github Pages as my means of hosting pictures of my furry friend, I realized how much
the Github Pages ecosystem has changed since I last used it. I was able to follow along with the [github pages gallery repo](https://github.com/gautamkrishnar/github-pages-gallery)
to bootstrap a trivial photo gallery for Zee in just a few minutes. How awesome is that? Highly reccomend the github pages gallery setup if you are ever in need of a trivial
image gallery in a pinch.

The fact that github pages and github actions are completely free is amazing. I sure hope more infrastructure becomes free or even low cost in the coming years!
